# f1-data-analysis

A data analysis project inside python, using fastf1 to get real f1 telemtry. Then analysising the telemtry in order to gain knowledge of data-analysis inside python. 

**Version 1**
Learnt how to use fastf1 and plot the telemtry.
Analysis: 
*Hamilton remains faster in the high speed sections of the track (Gear 8) despite getting on the throttle at the same time as Verstappen, suggesting a lower downforce package. 
*Near the end of the lap (5000m) Verstappen gains time by getting on the throttle earlier. 
*From the graph of throttle trace it can be seen that Verstappen makes more 'aggressive' inputs, getting of and on throttle much quicker than Hamilton
